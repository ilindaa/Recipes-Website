Reflection:
First, I went back to the basics: HTML boilerplate, headings, text-based elements, lists, links, and images. It was simple but fun, I feel more confident after practicing my HTML fundamentals. I also learned a lot about using Git version control and Git Bash commands to push my code files to GitHub. After going over some CSS, I went back to make a website inspired by "Brutalist Websites" with CSS and JavaScript.
