# YouTuber Recipes Website

Live site: https://ilindaa.github.io/Recipes-Website

This project showcases featured food recipes from YouTubers. There is a home page for users to view featured recipes. Users can click on the links and learn the ingredients and steps needed to make the listed dish. This project is currently a work-in-progress. I hope to be able to improve the site with CSS and JavaScript animations in the future to make the site more visually appealing. 

Reflection:
First, I went back to the basics: HTML boilerplate, headings, text-based elements, lists, links, and images. It was simple but fun, I feel more confident about my HTML fundamentals. I learned a lot about using Git version control and Git Bash commands to push my code files to GitHub.
